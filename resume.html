                    I'm a self-taught programmer. After getting a math degree on the East coast, I worked my way across
                    Canada, and have begun a career in software development on the West coast.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my spare time, I make games and small programming languages, pushing the boundaries of
                    my abilities and imagination.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At work, I try to write boring, solid code, so that it doesn't break on production over the weekend.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To that end, I:
                    <ul>
                        <li>talk with other people whose code will interface with mine</li>
                        <li>spend time with management and clients hashing out requirements</li>
                        <li>write code in manageable units with small APIs, a bit of documentation, and a couple of tests</li>
                    </ul>
                    I'm interested in working with people who share my passion, which is: to create excellent software.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A huge bonus for me would be spare time to study new technologies and work on my own projects.

                        I'm a full-stack developer in a small team at Mighty Oaks, creating grocery e-commerce software.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I maintain and extend:

                         - our internal e-commerce library

                        <br>
                        I use:
                        <br>
                         - Python, Django
                        <br>

                        <br>
                         - Postgres, Redis, Celery, ElasticSearch, uWSGI, NGINX
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        QBASIC, Visual Basic, Flash, C/C++
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned to code by making DOS games in QBASIC, 15 years ago or so.
                        <br>
                        I moved through VB and Flash to arrive at C/C++.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At some point I became sidetracked with programming language design and implementation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The two passions feed into each other fairly well: a good usability test for a language is to write a game engine in it.
